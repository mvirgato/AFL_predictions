# AFL Match Predictors

This project was a way for me to get familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning and practicing data analysis with Pandas dataframes.
This is only a bit of fun, not for any serious gambling. I don't care about football, and this seemed more fun than guessing every week in the family tipping pool.
